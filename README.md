# HTML5 Game Jam with CraftyJS

This is a starter pack for RPG games that allows you to import animated sprites from the [BrowserQuest project](https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest/). You can play it [here](http://mindcandy.github.com/crafty-starter-game-rpg/).

To run this project you should execute the run-server.sh script and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). This requires Python and bash.
